# Algorithm
An attempt to implement several Algorithms and Data Structures in various Programming Languages.

Currently we are building Algorithms in C#, Java and Python.

The aim is to Maintain the Same Interface and Functionality throughout all the Languuages.

## Some GuideLines
1. Maintain each Classes/Modules in Seperate Code Files
2. Maintain the code well documented (like JavaDoc)
3. More to Come Soon!

### Note
Class Specific Guidelines are maintained at [CommonDocs](CommonDocs/)
